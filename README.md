# ML_Capstone

## Project Status

This was my first project when I started learning machine learning.  
Initially, the development was paused as I focused on understanding the fundamentals.  

Now, Iâ€™m revisiting the project to rebuild it with a more modular and industry-standard structure.  
The first step is reorganizing the files and folders to make the project cleaner and easier to maintain.
